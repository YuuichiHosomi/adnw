startup even if TP is disabled
macro do not echo key after macro
dedicated macro key
strg stuck
revert multimodekey
debug mode to configure features while running (PinkyDrop, ThumpShift)
make matrix a matrix
copy paste on mouse middle btn
### DONE ####
PS/2 buttons
Mouse buttons, move on windows
move mod4 to shifted mod3 Not very efficient, double usage of modifiers with standard keys is better
F1-12
timeout modekey toggle
trackpoint
    timeout, mousemode only temporary and on selected button keys!

### Ideas ####

- new 3D design, mainly thumbkeys
- Macro + shifted macro causes spurious press?
- programming macros on edges?

- prntscreen...

- debug output of layout
- openmoko touchpad?

- macro mode

- multiple layouts -> fixed based layer toggle


### ModKey toggle: Ctrl-Tab needs separate Tab
Ctrl-Alt-Fx
Ctrl-Alt-Del
ctrl-alt       vmware
(ctrl)shift + direction

!
win  alt  shft ctrl  | -  mod3 mod4  altgr
