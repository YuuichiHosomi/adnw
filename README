The driver was originally based on humblehackers hhkb firmware, but I found some things (while pretty neat and cleanly implemented) a little too difficult to adjust, so I revamped everything but the most basic USB code.

PS/2 support is credited in large part to Akshay Srinivasan<akshaysrinivasan@nitk.ac.in>

You will need a recent version of the LUFA usb stack to compile this software, I use git revision 29be35a8 from June 3, 2012 currently. Note that the new makefile system of this lib does not yet work for me. If you want scrollwheel support for the mouse, the included patch needs to be applied.
From this root directory, execute
  git clone https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa-lib.git 
  ln -sf lufa-lib/trunk LUFA
