The driver was originally based on humblehackers hhkb firmware, but I found some things (while pretty neat and cleanly implemented) a little too difficult to adjust, so I revamped everything but the most basic USB code.

Maybe in the future I might come back to the original source, but for now the hardware prototype needs some more refinements.
